## Description

This is a fork of `mapped-types` from [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), but generalized to be used in other projects.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i --save @nikaple/mapped-types
```

## Quick Start

As you build out features, it's often useful to construct variants on a base entity type. A good example of such a variant is a **Data Transfer Object** (DTO). A Data Transfer Object is an object that is used to encapsulate data, and send it from one part of your application to another. DTOâ€™s help us define the input and output interfaces of our system.

Let's imagine a real-world example, where we typically need to build both a **create** and **update** variations for the same entity type.

The create variant may require all fields, while the update variant may make all fields **optional**. Not to mention, both these types can also be variants of an entity type (to some extent).

That's a lot of redundant code!

Thus, this project now provides several utility functions that perform type transformations to help us avoid doing this, and make life a little bit easier.

Available mapped types:

- `PartialType` - returns a type (class) with all the properties of the input type set to optional (requirement: at least 1 validation decorator applied to each property)
- `PickType` - constructs a new type (class) by picking a set of properties from an input type
- `OmitType` - constructs a type by picking all properties from an input type and then removing a particular set of keys
- `IntersectionType` - combines two types into one new type (class)
